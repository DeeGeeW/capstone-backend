In winter its feet are heavily feathered to the tips of the toes; these feathers increase the surface area of the feet and act as 'snowshoes,' allowing the birds to walk easily over fresh drifts.", background_url: "https://64.media.tumblr.com/e316487af781f8ce13eca6204bd9ff21/tumblr_nocj0xWrSe1shynwyo1_1280.png", comment_id: nil},
